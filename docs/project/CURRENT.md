# Current project state

Last updated: 2026-09-05
Phase: Progressive adoption and pre-production release evaluation.

Maru is an actively developed Django/PostgreSQL modular monolith, not a
production-ready release or supported hosted service. Use synthetic data only.
This file is the restart guide; the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) owns outcome sequencing,
the [production-consolidation ledger](PRODUCTION_CONSOLIDATION.md) retains the
detailed baseline, and [checkpoints](../checkpoints/index.md) preserve history.

## Latest completed product outcome

Programme review and accountable decisions (#71) were delivered through
[PR #72](https://github.com/martonpornoi/maru/pull/72), protected squash
`47960893902d910d86f9b5c8fe5d9b5b2dc65fed`. Issues #66 and #64 were already
closed through PRs #69 and #70. None of these is pending implementation.

Under ADR 0085, the dormant Applications kernel now supports exact-seal review
cases, immutable stage/rubric/template policies, independent scoring and
recusal, moderation/reopening, accountable decisions, and recipient-only
message acknowledgement. It retains audited, field-scoped projections,
canonical locking, runtime SELECT-only relations, readiness fingerprints, and
populated downgrade fences. Review-side acceptance does not create a Programme
item or host, and no Programme profile, route, UI, API, or worker is activated.

The tested PR head was `6cd0c317ecc9ad6262dbf2baa91649d4a91c8661`.
Its complete local certification passed 5,841 Python tests and 33 frontend
tests, all eight PostgreSQL shards, and the combined 90% branch-aware coverage
gate. Hosted [full acceptance](https://github.com/martonpornoi/maru/actions/runs/33975720775)
and [CodeQL](https://github.com/martonpornoi/maru/actions/runs/33975720037)
passed before merge. These are exact-revision results, not the current suite
count, deployment evidence, or production approval.

Detailed implementation and recovery evidence is in the
[review checkpoint](../checkpoints/2026-09-05-programme-staged-review-and-decisions.md),
[readiness correction](../checkpoints/2026-09-05-programme-review-readiness-follow-up.md),
[Applications contract](../modules/applications.md), and
[review recovery runbook](../operations/applications-programme-review-migration-and-recovery.md).

## Maintenance scope

Issue [#73](https://github.com/martonpornoi/maru/issues/73) reconciles this handoff
and the roadmap, and corrects both synthetic OCI rehearsal cleanup paths to
remove anonymous volumes associated with exact label-verified containers.
Named-volume cleanup, complete namespace checks, and stopped retention remain
separate and explicit. See the
[maintenance checkpoint](../checkpoints/2026-09-05-handoff-and-rehearsal-resource-hygiene.md)
and its linked PR for candidate-specific verification and delivery state.

Pre-existing Docker cleanup requires a separately approved exact inventory;
unrelated projects, persistent Maru data, and uncertain orphaned volumes must
not be pruned. Follow [local Docker housekeeping](../development/docker-housekeeping.md).
This maintenance does not implement a Programme child or optimize migrations.

## What can be evaluated today

- **Workforce-only:** guided edition adoption and the Organization structure,
  Position, Assignment, Availability, and Shift journey, including independent
  confirmation and retained personal history. It creates no unrelated
  Registration, Participation, payment, or attendance state. See the
  [Workforce contract](../modules/workforce.md) and
  [adoption/recovery runbook](../operations/workforce-only-adoption-and-recovery.md).
- **Programme foundations:** owned items and information/readiness layers
  (#61); Applications calls and acknowledged collaborative proposals (#63);
  preview-first import (#66); Department continuity (#64); review and decisions
  (#71). These remain dormant foundations, not a departmental workspace.
  [Events](../modules/events.md), [Applications](../modules/applications.md),
  and the [Programme Operations setup contract](../product/page-contracts/programme-operations-adoption-setup.md)
  own the details.
- **Release evaluation:** `v2026.08.27-rc.1` remains an immutable synthetic
  evaluation candidate. Exact-image runtime/static rehearsals and consumer
  integrity checks are bounded evidence, not provider or production acceptance.

## Smallest sensible next actions

1. Check #73's linked PR for its protected result. If it is already merged,
   do not repeat the maintenance delivery. This task stops at protected merge;
   checked-in candidate documentation does not predict that later event.
2. If separately authorized, approve and remove only identified disposable
   Docker resources. Resource cleanup and test-performance work are different
   outcomes.
3. Before further Programme work, evaluate the bounded Registration historical
   migration-test pilot. Reuse a committed baseline only for eligible serial
   cases; preserve committed round trips, downgrade fences, concurrency, and
   isolation. Measure whole-group setup, execution, and teardown. Do not weaken
   case selection, coverage, timeouts, or protected acceptance. See
   [testing strategy](../quality/testing-strategy.md) and the
   [existing isolation checkpoint](../checkpoints/2026-09-05-historical-migration-test-isolation.md).
4. Resume umbrella [#48](https://github.com/martonpornoi/maru/issues/48) only when
   requested: accepted-item conversion first, then host/co-host relationships
   and availability, Scheduling core and accessible editor, Workforce staffing,
   atomic release/outputs, on-site continuity, and integrated acceptance.
   Profile setup/activation comes after those mandatory continuations. Keep the
   umbrella open until the complete Programme-only journey is accepted.

Outside the Programme sequence, #42 owns the reproducible Workforce tutorial,
#22 continuity/reversible adoption, #23 the role-state accessibility matrix,
and #24 the later attendance/handover/actual-time contract. The roadmap and
live issue queue own further priorities; this maintenance does not reprioritize
or close them.

## Known risks and production gates

- Programme has no usable timetable, staffing/release workspace, on-site pack,
  or activated adoption profile. Dormant code is intentional, not abandoned.
- Workforce import/export, printable/manual fallback, reconciliation,
  expansion/decommissioning, and stopped-operation rehearsal are incomplete.
  Do not replace an incumbent system based on scoped pages or APIs alone.
- Representative accessibility (including screen readers, keyboard, zoom,
  widths, and disclosure/mutation states) and two-human owner acceptance remain
  open. Synthetic sessions and automated tests do not replace those gates.
- Provider certification, deployment/stopped-writer cutover, runtime-role
  provisioning, restore/PITR, worker supervision, load, telemetry, privacy,
  safeguarding, training, and operational owner acceptance remain open.
- Availability disposal needs approved retention, legal holds, observable
  execution, and recovery. No production personal data is authorized.
- Historical-model reconstruction is a measured test bottleneck. Documentation
  and Docker disk cleanup do not establish a migration-test speedup.

## Resume safely

Follow `AGENTS.md`, this handoff, the roadmap, then the task's requirements,
owning module/runbook, ADR index and related decisions, and code/tests. Use the
[agent-assisted workflow guide](../development/agent-workflows.md) to select
only matching procedures; historical checkpoints are consulted as needed.

Preserve scope-before-disclosure authorization, immutable evidence, canonical
lock order, runtime-role containment, and fix-forward recovery. NFR-013 forbids
unadopted module side effects. Retired-route guards, migrations, ADRs, and
historical checkpoints are not cleanup targets. Keep focused evidence, exact
local certification, protected hosted acceptance, and production approval
distinct. Replace superseded status rather than adding another delivery diary.
